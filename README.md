# HOME-PRICE-PREDICTION-PROJECT
Gathered the "Banglore home prices" dataset from kaggle in a dataset of about 13,000 properties with detailed attributes. Split the dataset into an 80-20 training-testing split, fine-tuned model hyperparameters, and performed cross-validation to ensure robust performance. Built a machine learning model and achieved an accuracy of 80%.
